# svlearn

A comprehensive collection of Machine Learning algorithms implemented from scratch, without using high-level ML libraries such as scikit-learn.

The goal of this repository is to deeply understand the math, logic, and internal workflows behind popular ML models by building them using only NumPy, Python, and fundamental concepts.
